# INES Specification (ines-spec)

The INES (Interoperable Energy System) Specification defines a standardized data format for exchanging energy system models. This specification aims to facilitate interoperability between different energy modeling tools and platforms.

## Overview

The INES Specification is designed to support the seamless exchange of energy system data. It is currently hosted by the Spine Toolbox database file `ines-spec.sqlite` and requires Spine Toolbox v0.8 or later. The specification is also available in JSON and YAML formats for faster access.

## Features

- **Interoperability**: Enables the exchange of data between various energy modeling tools.
- **Flexibility**: Supports complex parameter structures and alternative parameter values to facilitate scenario building.
- **Compatibility**: Compatible with Spine Toolbox v0.8 and later versions.

## Installation

To use the INES Specification, you need to have Spine Toolbox v0.8 or later installed. You can download Spine Toolbox from the official [Spine Toolbox repository](https://github.com/spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox).

## Usage

- **Edit data yourself** Use Spine Toolbox database editor to add and edit data
- **Transform existing model data to ines** Use one of the adjacent repositories (e.g. ines-osemosys) to translate an existing energy system model to the ines format
- **Transform ines data to energy system model format** Use one of the adjacent repositories (e.g. ines-flextool) to translate data from the ines format to an existing energy system model format
- **Use data pipelines** The adjacent repository data-pipelines has scripts and data sources that can be imported to ines-spec to create a model instance
